# Basic If-Else Statement

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
else
    # Code to execute if the condition is false
fi
```

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

number=15

if [ $number -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "The number is greater than 10."
else
    echo "The number is not greater than 10."
fi
```

# Nested If-Else Statements

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
    # Code to execute if the condition1 is true
else
    if [ condition2 ]; then
        # Code to execute if the condition2 is true
    else
        # Code to execute if all the conditions are false
    fi
fi
```

## Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

value=7

if [ $value -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "The value is greater than 10."
else
    if [ $value -lt 10 ]; then
        echo "The value is less than 10."
    else
        echo "The value is exactly 10."
    fi
fi
```

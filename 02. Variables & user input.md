## Variables

Variables in shell scripts are used to store data such as numbers, strings, and file paths. Some common types of variables include:

- **Scalar Variables**: These hold a single value. Examples include:
  ```bash
  name="John"
  age=30
  ```

- **Arrays**: Arrays allow you to store multiple values under a single variable name. Example:
  ```bash
  fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
  ```

- **Environment Variables**: These are predefined variables that store information about the system environment. Example:
   ```bash
  echo "The home directory is: $HOME"
  ```

## Accessing Variables

- To access the value stored in a variable, prefix it with the $ symbol. For example:
  ```bash
  echo "My name is $name, and I am $age years old."
  ```

- To access array variable
  ```bash
  first_fruit="${fruits[0]}"   # Access the first element
  second_fruit="${fruits[1]}"  # Access the second element
  ```

## User Input

- User input is crucial for making scripts interactive. You can use the read command to prompt the user for input and store it in a variable.
  ```bash
  echo "Enter your name: "
  read username
  echo "Hello, $username!"
  ```

## Reading Passwords Securely

- To read passwords securely without displaying the input on the screen, you can use the read command with the -s (silent) option:
  ```bash
  echo "Enter your password: "
  read -s password
  ```

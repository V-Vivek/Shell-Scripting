# Introduction to Shell Scripting

Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks and perform various operations in a Unix or Linux environment. It involves writing a series of commands in a script file, which can be executed as a single program.

## What is a Shell Script?

A shell script is a plain text file that contains a sequence of commands for the shell (command-line interpreter) to execute. These scripts are written using a shell scripting language, such as Bash, which is the default shell for most Unix-like systems.

## Why Use Shell Scripts?

Shell scripts offer several advantages:

- **Automation**: You can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
- **Customization**: You can tailor scripts to your specific needs and environment.
- **Batch Processing**: Perform tasks on multiple files or directories.
- **System Administration**: Manage system configurations and maintenance.
- **Complex Operations**: Execute complex sequences of commands.

## Identifying you Shell

The importance of identifying the type of shell while writing shell scripts lies in ensuring compatibility and proper execution of your scripts.

In a terminal, run the following command:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```

The output will display the path to the default shell. Common shell paths include:

- **/bin/bash** for the Bash shell
- **/bin/sh** for the Bourne shell (or a compatible shell)
- **/bin/zsh** for the Zsh shell
- **/bin/dash** for the Debian Almquist shell (used in some minimal Debian-based systems)

## Writing Your First Shell Script

To create a simple shell script, follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`, `gedit`).
2. Write shebang line (the first line of the script) to scecify the type of shell.
3. Write your script, including necessary commands and comments.
4. Save the file with a `.sh` extension. Note that extension doesn't matter but it is a good practice to help us identify the script files easily.
5. Make the script executable using the `chmod` command: `chmod +x myscript.sh`.
6. Run the script: `./myscript.sh`.

Here's a basic example of a shell script that displays a "Hello, World!" message:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a simple shell script
echo "Hello, World!"
